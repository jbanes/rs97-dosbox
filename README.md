# RS97-dosbox

This project is a fork of the dosbox code from https://github.com/steward-fu/rs97_emulator.

If you just want to start using the program, you can grab the "dosbox" executable from dosbox/bin/dosbox, install it onto your RS97 and start having fun!

In case you want to compile this yourself, note that you'll need a MIPS toolchain built to /opt/buildroot on Linux (I'm using Ubuntu.) Simply run "make" and then "./package" to populate the bin/ folder.
